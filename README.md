## ⚡ Minimal Dark for Steam ⚡ <br> 

Minimal Dark is a personalized and customizable minimal theme for the new Steam interface (New UI). <br>
I started from the basic Steam skin using the development tool (DevTools) as well as notepad++. <br>
All the sources and tools I used are at the bottom of the description. <br>

I am neither a coder nor a developer, I have some knowledge after several years of practice and I do this in my free time when I have it. <br>
Be understanding if you encounter any bugs. <br>

## `🧪 Restylised vanilla skin topbar + UI enhancements 🧪` <br> 

![Minimal_Dark](https://github.com/SaiyajinK/Minimal-Dark-for-Steam/assets/105972098/aa20dbc9-3c0b-4504-8e86-24e9c5f9aeee) <br>

I created a minimal topbar to best optimize the space compared to the vanilla base. <br>
The home and collection button are now hidden to minimize the space taken up (they are accessible from the top bar). <br>

## `🎨 Customize theme with the color of your choice 🎨` <br> 

I'm not a fan of heavy interfaces with "uncoordinated" colors. So I did my best to have a theme with matching colorimetry. In building the skin, I defined a function on many elements that injects the color code defined in the configuration file across the entire skin and webkit. <br>

How change the skin color ? <br>
1. Open `config.css` with notepad++ and modify lines `4` and `5`. <br> 
2. Open `webkit.css` and modify lines `8` and `9` ; save and reload Steam. <br> 

⚠️ note: color settings reset with each update (for now).<br>

More simply : If you use the base color (which is Steam's default color, light blue): no problem since it is the base of the skin.<br>

On the other hand : If you use a custom color: you will have to redefine the custom color during EACH update (for the moment) whether manual (by opening millenium from Steam settings) or automatic (when launching or restarting Steam).<br>

Why ? : This is because Millennium, during an update reloads the entire Github directory and not just the updated files.<br>
I passed the information on to the dev, I'm waiting for his return (the problem does not occur with SFP).<br>

🗣️ Dev response : Millennium will be updated soon to resolve this issue to only update files changed during a skin update.

## `👤 Profil 👤` <br> 

I defined a static color by default which will have the effect of not displaying static or video backgrounds. <br>
If you want to remove this, open `webkit.css` and remove lines `98` to `106` and edit line `109`<br>
