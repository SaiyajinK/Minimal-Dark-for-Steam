## ⚡ Minimal Dark for Steam ⚡ <br> 
Minimal Dark is a personalized and customizable minimal theme for the new Steam interface (New UI). <br>

Initially, it was a skin that I had made only for myself. <br>
After some thought I decided to share it with other people. <br>

I started from the basic Steam skin using the development tool (DevTools) as well as notepad++. <br>
All the sources and tools I used are at the bottom of the description. <br>

I'm not a coder or developer, I have notions and I do this on my free time when I have some. <br>
Be understandable if you encounter some bugs. <br>

That said, I hope you enjoy the interface! <br>
> this sharing is non-profit ! <br>

## `🎨 Customize theme with the color of your choice!🎨` <br> 

How change the skin color ? <br>
Open `-config.css-` with notepad++ and modify `line 4` and `line 6` ; save and reload Steam. <br> 

## `🧪 Restylised vanilla skin topbar 🧪` <br> 

The home and collection button are now hidden to minimize the space taken up (they are accessible from the top bar). <br>

I'm not a fan of heavy interfaces with "uncoordinated" colors. So I created a minimal topbar to best optimize the space compared to the vanilla base. <br> 

## `🔄 Reboot/recharge menu 🔄` <br> 

I added a js script to the skin that adds the restart and refresh UI actions. <br>
`Script has shared on the unofficial metro discord` <br>

## `🌐 Dark webkit 🌐` <br> 
`Thanks Shiina for the base of the webkit` <br>
I re-edited and fix the whole code according to my theme. <br>
